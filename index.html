                            <img class = "image" src="images/MSIpic.jpg" alt= "Inside the MSI">

                            <div class="overlay">

                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>The first museum I ever went to and what has certainly inspired my lifelong desire to learn and
                            appreciate the carefully curated collections within cultural institutions. As a young child I entered
                            this museum and knew this was the happiest I had ever felt, and I had been to Disney before.
                            We traversed through a submarine, sat under the giant dome and learned about the universe,
                            walked among preserved parts of human bodies from all ages, and I loved every minute of it.</p>
                

                        <div class="container"> 
                            <a name="MET"></a>
                            <h2>The Metropolitan Museum of Art</h2>
                            <img class = "image" src="images/Met1.jpg" alt ="Huge Piece of Art at the Met">
                    
                            <div class="overlay">
                                <div class="text">New York City, New York</div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>Although this museum is known for being one of the best collections of art, history, and culture,
                            admission is donation based. I walked up the main stairs and was greeted by George
                            Washington crossing the Delaware River. I saw portraits of Van Gogh, Monat’s lillies, Italian
                            sculptures, crown jewels from lost civilizations, cracked pottery from the ancient city of Pompeo
                            and so, so, so many people. My favorite visit ended with looking out at the fall colors of Central Park from
                            the bay windows near the reflection pools, and I watched a man get down on one knee and ask
                            his partner to marry him. A memorable day for all.</p>

                            <h2>The Museum of Modern Art</h2>
                            <img class ="image" src="images/ChickenNoodleSoup.jpeg" alt="Looking at Andy Warhol's pop art"> 
                            
                            <div class="overlay">
                                <div class ="text">New York City, New York</div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>This visit started with a lecture on black representation within award winning documentaries. A
                            panel of experts reviewed and discussed the complexities of a film genre that I had never
                            considered before. Afterwards, I passed numerous paintings of chicken noodle soup on my way
                            to look at a Starry Night. Crowds swelled around the surprisingly small painting and we each
                            took our turn jumping in front of it for pictures. We walked around and enjoyed the rest of the
                            floor we were on, which included very pleasant interactive lazer shows.</p>
                
                        <div class="container"> 
                            <a name="AMWA"></a>
                            <h2>American Museum of Western Art</h2>
                            <img class ="image" src="images/Western-Art.jpeg">
                            
                            <div class="overlay">
                                <div class ="text">Denver, Colorado</div>
                            </div>
                         </div>

                        <p>The largest collection of indiginous art under one roof, rumor has it was almost completely donated by one person. The
                            museum sits on the quiet side of the mountain slope and has friendly staff to welcome you in. I
                            learned a lot about Native American’s and their everyday life prior to the near genocide the
                            colonizers inflicted upon their people. Interestingly, there were quite a few depictions of lone
                            cowboys and outlaws who had allied with many of the western tribes. The landscapes from the
                            artist’s were created with such detail, I felt like I could feel the sun through the trees or hear the
                            hooves of a horse walking on soil. Very different from the heavily eurocentric dominated museums I
                            have visited before.</p>

                            <h2>The National Museum of African American History &amp; Culture</h2>
                            <img class ="image" src="images/BHCM-exterior.jpeg" alt="Exterior of NMAAH">
                        
                            <div class="overlay">
                                <div class ="text">Washington D.C, U.S</div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>Like so many other wonderful museums at the nation’s capital, The NMAAHC is entirely free to
                            the public. It’s immediately striking the distinction of this building compared to the rest of the
                            National Mall. The building, I learned, was designed and inspired African American and West
                            African themes in the form, material, and color of the exterior and interior. I loved the excitement
                            from all the school aged children inside the halls. There were beautiful celebratory moments that
                            juxtaposed with deeply saddening and tragic realities that I had truthfully never heard about in
                            any of my history studies.</p>
                    
                        <div class="container"> 
                            <a name="SLAM"></a>
                            <h2>The St. Louis Art Museum</h2>
                            <img class ="image" src="images/SLAM.jpg" alt="Exterior of SLAM">
                            
                            <div class="overlay">
                                <div class="text">St. Louis, Missouri</div>
                            </div>
                        </div>

                        <p>The property the museum sits upon is so stunning it cannot be unmentioned. The sprawling hills
                            and foilage with statues peaking in and out provide serenity every season of the year. The
                            museum has several different era’s and is relatively easy to navigate. I was very pleasantly
                            surprised at how much I enjoyed the antique furniture posed in historically accurate rooms.
                            Even though it houses several famous and classical pieces of renaissance art, it never seems
                            too crowded to truly immerse yourself in the experience.</p>
